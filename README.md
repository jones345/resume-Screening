# resume-Screening

Introduction

Writing a resume is not a trivial task, especially when it comes to the right selection of keywords. People spend hours writing and formatting the perfect resume hoping it to be read by a talent acquisition professional and, eventually, help them land a job interview. Unfortunately, around 75% of resumes submitted are never seen by a human eye.
Due to the high number of applicants and resumes submissions to job postings, manual resumes screening processes become tedious, ineffective and time consuming for talent acquisition professionals. Therefore, standardized automated screening methods are necessary to categorize qualified from unqualified candidates based on their background, education and professional experience faster, with more efficiency and more accurate results to streamline hiring processes.

i will  build a resume screening Python program capable of categorizing keywords into six different concentration areas (e.g. quality/six sigma, operations management, supply chain, project management, data analytics and healthcare systems) and determining the one with the highest expertise level in an industrial and systems engineer resume. 

Letâ€™s test it on my resume and see the results!
